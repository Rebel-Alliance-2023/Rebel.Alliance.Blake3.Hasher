# BLAKE3Algorithm.cs Documentation

The `BLAKE3Algorithm` class contains the core implementation of the BLAKE3 hashing algorithm. It's an internal static class that provides the low-level operations required for BLAKE3 hashing.

## Class Definition

```csharp
static unsafe class BLAKE3Algorithm
```

## Constants

- `FlagChunkStart` (uint): Flag indicating the start of a chunk.
- `FlagChunkEnd` (uint): Flag indicating the end of a chunk.
- `FlagParent` (uint): Flag for parent nodes in the hash tree.
- `FlagRoot` (uint): Flag for the root node of the hash tree.
- `FlagKeyedHash` (uint): Flag for keyed hashing mode.
- `FlagDeriveKeyContext` (uint): Flag for key derivation context.
- `FlagDeriveKeyMaterial` (uint): Flag for key derivation material.

- `IVConstants` (uint[]): Initial vector constants used in the BLAKE3 algorithm.

## Structures

### TreeNode

Represents a node in the BLAKE3 hash tree.

- `ChainingValue` (uint[]): The chaining value of the node.
- `Level` (int): The level of the node in the tree.

### State

Represents the current state of the BLAKE3 hashing process.

- `ProcessedChunks` (long): The number of chunks processed so far.
- `Stack` (Stack<TreeNode>): A stack of tree nodes used in the hashing process.

## Methods

### ResetState

```csharp
public static void ResetState(State state)
```

Resets the given state to its initial values.

### HashFullChunksWhichAreNotTheLast

```csharp
public static void HashFullChunksWhichAreNotTheLast(byte* input, long chunksCount, State state)
```

Processes full chunks of input data, updating the state. This method is used for all chunks except the last one.

### HashLastChunk

```csharp
public static byte[] HashLastChunk(byte* input, long blocksCount, uint lastBlockLength, State state)
```

Processes the last chunk of input data and computes the final hash value.

### MergeTreeNodesWithSameLevel

```csharp
static void MergeTreeNodesWithSameLevel(State state)
```

Merges tree nodes at the same level in the hash tree, building up the tree structure.

### ComputeHashFromCurrentState

```csharp
private static byte[] ComputeHashFromCurrentState(State state)
```

Computes the final hash value from the current state of the hash tree.

### CompressionFunction

```csharp
static void CompressionFunction(uint* input, uint* h, long counter, uint blockLength, uint flags, uint* output)
```

The core compression function of BLAKE3. This function processes a single 64-byte block of data.

### G

```csharp
static void G(uint* inOuta, uint* inOutb, uint* inOutc, uint* inOutd, uint m0, uint m1)
```

The G function used in the compression function. This is the core mixing function of BLAKE3.

### SetInitialChainingValuesForHash

```csharp
static void SetInitialChainingValuesForHash(uint* output)
```

Sets the initial chaining values for a new hash computation.

## Algorithm Overview

1. The input data is processed in 1KiB chunks.
2. Each chunk is further divided into 64-byte blocks.
3. The compression function is applied to each block, updating the chaining value.
4. The results of chunk processing are organized into a tree structure.
5. The tree is merged upwards to produce the final hash value.

This implementation uses unsafe code and pointer arithmetic for performance optimization, which is common in cryptographic implementations. The use of a tree structure allows for potential parallelization of the hashing process for large inputs.
